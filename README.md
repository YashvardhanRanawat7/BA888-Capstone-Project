# BA888-Capstone-Project

The aiDashboard project aimed to create an intuitive dashboard solution for QuickBooks customers. The primary objectives included developing a business dashboard, creating a template library, testing HeronAI products, and designing a Chrome extension. Let’s explore the key aspects of this project:
Research and Planning:
The team conducted thorough research to understand user requirements and existing dashboard solutions.
They created Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to model the data structure and relationships.
Mapping templates to relevant APIs was a crucial step in ensuring seamless integration.
Template Library:
The project involved building a comprehensive template library. These templates covered various business scenarios, such as financial reporting, inventory management, and sales analytics.
Templates were designed to be customizable, allowing users to tailor them to their specific needs.
Frontend Development:
The frontend team focused on enhancing visual capabilities. They worked on creating interactive charts, graphs, and widgets.
Technologies like React, D3.js, and Plotly were used to build dynamic and responsive components.
HeronAI vs. Control Groups:
The team conducted experiments comparing HeronAI-generated insights with control groups.
Metrics such as accuracy, speed, and user satisfaction were evaluated.
HeronAI consistently outperformed other methods, providing more accurate predictions and actionable insights.
Bug Identification and Resolution:
During testing, the team encountered several bugs related to data synchronization, rendering issues, and API calls.
Rigorous testing and debugging were essential to ensure a smooth user experience.
Statistical Analysis:
Experiment results were analyzed statistically using Python libraries (pandas, scipy, and statsmodels).
Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals helped validate the effectiveness of HeronAI.
Chrome extension:
Built a mockup for a chrome extension using Figma. Designed the chatbot and the login page.
Built the mockup into a chrome extension using Javascript, HTML and CSS. This can be installed and used on chrome.
In summary, the aiDashboard project successfully delivered an intuitive business dashboard, leveraging HeronAI’s capabilities. The team’s dedication to research, testing, and frontend development contributed to its overall success.
